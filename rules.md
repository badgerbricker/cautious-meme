# X-Team 125 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will first divvy up the work into four equal sized parts, so each team member is contributing to the project equally. Then we will assign these chunks based on preference. If conflict arises on a preference of work, we will do rock-paper-scissors to decide who gets to work on that part.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Each team member will come up with a roadmap of weekly milestones for their portion of the work. We will have weekly meetings to make sure that we are all hitting our goals, and if a single part turns out to be more work than we thought, we can reevaluate the distribution of work. 

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

With our weekly meetings, we will go over the difficulties we had or are still having. Group members can provide help and advice on how to overcome that difficulty. Additionally, if a group member is struggling and asks for help, we can set up an in-person meeting or communicate the difficulty over email.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Group members should communicate early and often in regards to their progress and assigned tasks. Additionally, our weekly meetings will help us check up on each other to make sure that we are on track to meet our deadlines. If we miss a deadline, we should reflect on what went wrong and come up with a plan to fix it for the future.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

Respect other member of the team.
