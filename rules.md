# X-Team 125 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will first divvy up the work into four equal sized parts, so each team member is contributing to the project equally. Then we will assign these chunks based on preference and ability to complete the given task as determined by the other team members. If conflict arises on a preference of work and both members posses equal levels of skill, we will do best two out of three rock-paper-scissors(throwing your sign on "shoot" of "rock, paper, scissors, shoot") to decide who gets to work on that part.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Collectively as a team we will come up with a roadmap and major milestones for the project. Then, using the group timeline, each team member will come up with a roadmap of weekly milestones for their portion of the work. Each individual member timeline is subject to review by other members of the team.  We will have weekly meetings to make sure that we are all hitting our goals, and if a single part turns out to be more work than we thought, we can reevaluate the distribution of work. 

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

With our weekly meetings, we will go over the difficulties we had or are still having. Group members can provide help and advice on how to overcome that difficulty. Additionally, if a group member is struggling and asks for help, we can set up an in-person meeting to work through the issue or offer support over email or other forms of electronic communication. Lastly if the difficulty can not be resolved within the group, the group will seek the help of the TAs or professor.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Group members should communicate early and often in regards to their progress and assigned tasks. Additionally, our weekly meetings will help us check up on each other to make sure that we are on track to meet our deadlines. If we miss a deadline, we should reflect on what went wrong and come up with a plan to fix it for the future. Extra work will be put in to make up for any missed deadline in order to ensure the project is completed ontime. Team members who have an exceptionally busy week might recieve a lighter work load for that week if other team members are willing to pick up the slack, however team members should not rely on this and will be expected to make up their lighter weekly assignment with a heavier one at a later point in time if need be.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

* Respect other members of the team.
* Be on time and come prepared to meetings.
* Make an effort to resolve conflicts instead of ignoring the issue and disreguarding the opinions of fellow team members.
* Give all team members an opportunity to have their voice and opinions heard.
* Majority rules, if a majority of the team agrees upon something then thats the way it will be regardless of your personal opinions.
* Be vocal and upfront about any issues.
* Be in constant communication with other team members, respond to emails and other forms of communication in a timely yet resonable manner and be vocal at in person meetings.
